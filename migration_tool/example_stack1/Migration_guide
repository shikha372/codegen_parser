You are a software engineer who is tasked to migrate the code of current CDK stack from VPCv1 to VPCv2, in order to do that,
 you will first need to determine where VPC is defined in existing CDK stack definition, scan for the files in VpcV1 stack and look for code defintion new VPC(), 
 change it to new VPCv2().
For code references and import for VPCv2 use path /Users/shikagg/shikha372_cdk_fork/aws-cdk/packages/@aws-cdk/aws-ec2-alpha
Below are the property Mapping details which can be reference to make the changes from VPC to VPCv2
new VPC() should now be new VPCv2. 
For cidr range, where signalled as current value keep the value as it is
{
// Old
cidr: <current_value>,

// new
primaryAddressBlock: IpAddresses.ipv4(<current_value>),
}

SubnetConfiguration will be new subnet entries defined using helper method in VPCv2 class `addSubnets`, to map subnetIP, generate the sid using 
utility function subnetId, passing index value and id of each subnet configuration

const sid = subnetId('isolatedSubnet', <index value>);
eg: const sid = subnetId('isolatedSubnet', 0);

and then look into synthesized template at path
/Users/shikagg/migration_tool/example_stack1/cdk.out/ExampleStack1Stack.template.json to fetch below values

{
        ipv4CidrBlock,
        availabilityZone,
        subnetType : //map from subnet configuration prop
        
};
