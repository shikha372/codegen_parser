# Product Context

## Purpose
This migration project exists to update the AWS CDK stack from VPCv1 to VPCv2, ensuring the infrastructure code stays current with AWS CDK's latest best practices and features.

## Problems Solved
1. **Technical Debt Resolution**
   - Migrates away from deprecated VPCv1 constructs
   - Adopts modern VPCv2 patterns
   - Ensures long-term maintainability

2. **Infrastructure Modernization**
   - Leverages latest AWS CDK capabilities
   - Implements current best practices for VPC configuration
   - Provides access to new VPCv2 features

3. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Reduces dependency on older constructs
   - Ensures continued AWS support
   - Maintains infrastructure stability

## Expected Behavior
- All existing VPC functionality must be preserved
- CIDR ranges must remain unchanged
- Network connectivity must be maintained
- Infrastructure deployments must remain reliable

## User Experience Goals
### For Infrastructure Team
- Clear migration path from v1 to v2
- Minimal risk during transition
- Easy rollback capability if needed
- Maintainable code structure

### For Application Teams
- Zero downtime during migration
- No changes to application connectivity
- Preserved network configurations
- Consistent infrastructure behavior

## Success Metrics
1. **Technical Success**
   - All VPCv1 constructs replaced with VPCv2
   - Successful infrastructure deployment
   - All tests passing
   - No network disruption

2. **Operational Success**
   - Clean migration with no rollbacks
   - Preserved CIDR configurations
   - Maintained network connectivity
   - No application impact

## Future Considerations
1. **Extensibility**
   - New VPCv2 features can be adopted
   - Modern networking patterns available
   - Enhanced integration capabilities

2. **Maintenance**
   - Simplified updates with current constructs
   - Better alignment with AWS best practices
   - Reduced technical debt
