# Progress Tracking

## Completed Work
- ✅ Initialized memory bank with core documentation files
- ✅ Documented project requirements and migration rules
- ✅ Set up parallel implementation structure with v1 and v2 stack files

## In Progress
- 🔄 Initial analysis of existing VPC configurations
- 🔄 Planning VPC migration strategy

## Pending Work
- ⏳ Identify all VPC instances in current stack
- ⏳ Implement VPCv2 migrations
- ⏳ Update CIDR configurations
- ⏳ Test migrations
- ⏳ Validate network connectivity
- ⏳ Update unit tests

## Known Issues
None identified yet - initial setup phase

## Migration Status
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Memory Bank | ✅ Complete | Core documentation initialized |
| VPC Analysis | 🔄 In Progress | Need to analyze existing VPC configurations |
| VPC Migration | ⏳ Pending | Awaiting completion of analysis phase |
| Testing | ⏳ Pending | Will begin after initial migration |

## Next Actions
1. Analyze `example_stack1-stack.ts` for VPC configurations
2. Document all instances of `new VPC()`
3. Plan property mapping for each VPC instance
4. Begin implementation in `example_stack1-stack-v2.ts`

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All VPC instances identified
- [ ] All CIDR ranges documented
- [ ] VPCv2 implementations complete
- [ ] Tests updated and passing
- [ ] Network connectivity verified
