# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Initializing the memory bank for the VPC migration project
- Preparing for the migration from VPCv1 to VPCv2 in AWS CDK

## Recent Changes
- Created core memory bank files:
  - projectbrief.md
  - techContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - productContext.md

## Next Steps
1. Analyze the existing VPC configuration in `example_stack1-stack.ts`
2. Identify all instances of `new VPC()` that need to be migrated
3. Plan the migration strategy for each VPC instance
4. Begin implementation in `example_stack1-stack-v2.ts`
5. Update tests to reflect VPCv2 changes

## Active Decisions
- Using a parallel implementation strategy with separate v1 and v2 stack files
- Maintaining existing CIDR ranges during migration
- Focusing on a one-to-one migration of VPC properties where possible

## Current Considerations
- Need to verify if any VPCv2-specific features can enhance the current infrastructure
- Consider the impact on existing resources that depend on the VPC
- Evaluate if any additional AWS CDK constructs need updates alongside the VPC migration
